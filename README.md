# Mappit Jr.

Mappit Jr. is an interactive map made with leaflet and openstreetmap.org map tiles using the ReactJs front-end framework. Custom marker pins, with custom icons, showing points of interest (government facilities in this case) have been added on the map.

## Features

- An interactive responsive map centered on the city of Toronto, marking down government facilities such as parks, hospitals and universities on the map.

- Interactive marker pins using custom icons, which can be clicked to display more information about the location, and even further details in a modal.

- Buttons to re-center the map on the city, and jump to the user's location.

- A select field listing the points of interest, and by selecting a particular POI, the user can center on that location.

- A search box which allows users to filter locations by keywords input in the box.

## Future Updates

- More markers to cover more area, making it a true digital yellow pages for city services.

- More themes for tiles and display.
